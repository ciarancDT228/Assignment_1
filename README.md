Data Visualisation of Camera dataset

Originally I wanted to do some data visualisation based on historical weather datasets, but I had great difficulty in finding some decent datasets for this online.

In the end, I ran out of time, and had to just take the first viable dataset I could find, which happened to be on cameras. It has information like model name, weight, price, etc. I used this data to make a scatterplot graph and a piechart.

#Scatterplot
I made this as a class. The file name is Scatter.pde.

Instead of just choosing two attributes like price and zoom, I instead made a sort of menu to go with the scatterplot. This allows the user to choose what attributes go on what axis and thus generate many different scatterplot graphs based on what inputs they choose. The user can then determine if any relationships exist based on the resulting scatterplot.

#Piechart
This is a visualisation from class. It just counts how many of each brand of camera is in the dataset and then displays this as a pie chart. It's very basic, and the colours being completely random does not help at all with the presentation.

#Note
Due to time constraints this project is very basic. This is evident due to the blocky, boring presentation of the menus and colour scheme. Using classes helped with organisation of the code, but no inheritance, composition, or polymorphism etc was used. These could have been used to make the code much more efficient.
